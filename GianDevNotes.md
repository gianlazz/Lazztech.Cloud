## july, 27, 2018
Finished getting docker-compose.yml configured to bind mount volumes to services by absolute path.

Why doesn't docker-compose up work? It always says that it can't find the docker-compose.dcsproj. Running the docker-compose.dcsproj from vs4mac doesn't seem to have this issue if I run the command then run it in vs4mac... Weird.

Having issues with the working directory for the Process object running the correct path for the face_recognition arguments.
